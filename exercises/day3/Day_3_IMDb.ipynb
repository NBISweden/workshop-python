    "1. Use the code from above, but instead of creating an empty list before starting to loop over the file, create an empty dictionary\n",

    "3. Loop over the dictionary and calculate the average of the list\n",
    "4. Format the average (that is in seconds) to hours and minutes by dividing appropriately\n",

    "### 4. Re-structure and write the output to a new file as below\n",

    "1. Use the code above, but instead of just adding the runtime as a list element to each genre, add a list (or tuple) of items (rating, movie, year, runtime) to the list.
