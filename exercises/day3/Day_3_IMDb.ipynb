    "1. Create an empty list outside the loop where you will collect all the different genres\n",

    "1. Use the code from above, but instead of creating an empty list before starting to loop over the file, create an empty dictionary\n",

    "2. For each new movie, append the runtime to the existing list, so by the end of the loop you have, for each genre, a list of the runtimes for all movies in that genre\n",
    "3. Loop over the dictionary and calculate the average of the list\n",
    "4. Format the average (that is in seconds) to hours and minutes by dividing appropriately\n",
    "5. Print the results, or save them to a variable or file\n",

    "### 4. Re-structure and write the output to a new file as below\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the code above, but instead of just adding the runtime as a list element to each genre, add a list (or tuple) of items (rating, movie, year, runtime) to the list. In the end you will for each genre have a list of lists (or tuples), containing all the relevant information for each movie\n",
