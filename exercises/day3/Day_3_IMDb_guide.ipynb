If it is not, add it as a key with the value 1 (as this is the first occurrence of the genre). Remember to think about the upper/lower case problem, and make everything lowercase before comparing or adding to the dictionary.\n",

    "1. This question is similar to the previous, but instead of number of movies in each genre we want to find out the average length of the movies in each genre. So a good starting point is to use the same dictionary that we used in the previous exercise.\n",
    "2. Locate the column where the runtime is listed (you can manually inspect the file) and save it to a variable.\n",
    "3. Instead of just counting the number of occurrences for each genre, we here want to save all the runtimes for movies in a specific genre. So instead of having an integer as a value in our dictionary, we can have a list containing the runtimes instead. If the genre does not exist, add it to the list as a value, containing the runtime. If the genre exists already, append the runtime to the already existing list.\n",
    "4. Once you have a dictionary with the runtimes for all the movies listed, we need to loop over this dictionary to calculate the average. But first, print your dictionary just to visually inspect how it looks.\n",
    "5. For each genre in the dictionary, calculate the mean runtime by summing up all runtimes in the list, and divide by the number of entries.\n",
    "6. As this gives you the runtime in seconds, we need to convert this to hours first, so divide the number with 3600, and save it as an `integer` to get the number of whole hours.\n",
    "7. Calculate how many minutes are left by `runtime/(hours*3600)/60`. As we don't care about the seconds, you can just round the minutes.\n",
    "8. Print genre, hours, and minutes for each iteration in the loop.\n"

In this case it's still sorted according to genres, which means we can re-use the genre dictionary we have used before. We also want to save information from every movie, just like with the runtime, so the previous code still works. The difference here is that we want to save even more information, so instead of just appending a value to the list, as we did with the runtime, we have to append more. In this case a list in a list is a good option. It could for example in the end have the structure as below:\n"
