# Description

This course provides a practical introduction to the writing of
Python programs for the complete novice. Participants are lead
through the core aspects of Python illustrated by a series of
example programs. Upon completion of the course, attentive
participants will be able to write simple Python programs from
scratch and to customize more complex code to fit their needs.

# Audience and Prerequisites

* The course is suitable for complete beginners and assumes no prior
  programming experience (beyond the ability to use a text editor).
* A very basic knowledge of UNIX would be an advantage, such as
  navigating through folders and issuing commands at a shell
  prompt. We will not teach Unix in detail: Other course are available
  at SciLifeLab for it.
* Bring your own laptop with python installed for the practical
  exercises. Otherwise, please contact <a
  href="mailto:dimitrios.bampalikis@nbis.se?subject=[Python HT24] I need a laptop">Dimitris Bampalikis</a> before the course starts.
* Due to limited space the course can accommodate maximum of 25 participants in Uppsala and 15 in Umeå and Lund.
  If we receive more applications, participants will be selected based on
  several criteria. Selection criteria include correct entry requirements,
  motivation to attend the course as well as gender and geographical balance.

# Course Content

During this course, you will learn about:

* Core concepts about Python syntax: Data types, blocks and indentation, variable scoping, iteration, functions, methods and arguments
* Different ways to control program flow using loops and conditional tests
* Regular expressions and pattern matching
* Writing functions and best-practice ways of making them usable
* Reading from and writing to files
* Code packaging and Python libraries
* How to work with biological data using external libraries (if time allows).

# Learning Objectives

After this course you should be able to:

* Edit and run Python code
* Write file-processing python programs that produce output to the terminal and/or external files.
* Create stand-alone python programs to process biological data
* Know how to develop your skills in Python after the course (including debugging)

# Format

* This course runs in parallel on-site in Uppsala, Umeå and Lund. Lectures will be streamed from our Uppsala site
* Presentations and demonstrations
* Practical exercises (both as lab assignments with assistants in the calssroom and on your own)

Main teachers: Nina Norgren, Dimitrios Bampalikis, Nanjiang Shu

Prior to the course, you can read a companion
book
["Programming Python"](//shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596158118.do),
or
["Learning Python"](//shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028154.do). Such
a book will also prove useful for your programming tasks, after the
course is over. It is however not required, and material will be
presented in class.

# Course fee

A course fee of 3000 SEK will be invoiced to accepted participants.
