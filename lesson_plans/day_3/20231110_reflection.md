# Reflection 2023-10-11 Day 3, Richel

My teacher goals for the lesson were:

 * [G1] Engage all students
 * [G2] Have readable slides
 * [G3] Develop the material in 1 day
 * [G4] Take enough breaks
 * [G5] No excuses for the choices I made due to
   these time constraints

This goals have all been met, as can be read below.

Things that went well:

 * [W1] Being able to observe flaws
 * [W2] Handling feedback
 * [W3] Time management without a schedule
 * [W4] Student that took the time to compliment me

Things that could be improved:

 * [I1] The amount of TAs
 * [I2] The learning line of the teaching materials

Things to discuss:

 * [D1] Have requirements for TAs

Things to do different next time:

 * [N1] Try to get 1 TA
 * [N2] Do TDD
 * [N3] Do live coding

## [G1] Engage all students

This was the hardest thing to find out:
how does one teach in two different locations?

I used a shared HackMD document and timed with a naive learner how
quickly he/she would be able to edit a HackMD document.
This was less than 1 minute.

The HackMD contained, per question/exercise a list of all students' names.
This worked great in getting to know the students:
there are some students in Ume√• that I think I can describe their personality:
sure I can be wrong, but I do have a hypothesis I can defend :-) 

The HackHD worked out way better than I expected.
I took the time (3 minutes!) to let all students fill in a general
question. It was long enough.

## [G2] Have readable slides

This was the scariest thing in my preparation schedule.
I dared to take the time to figure this out
and I am happy with the result.

## [G3] Develop the material in 1 day

I did.

## [G4] Take enough breaks

I had an espeak script to help me remind when to take breaks.
I would always take the breaks.
I had slides that showed the start and end of each break.
It was quite clear.

## [G5] No excuses for the choices I made

I've never doubted the choices I made.

For example, I did not update the course schedule on Studium/Canvas.
That was just fine: I did a good job at sharing the schedule in the slides.

Another example was the course content.
It was good enough and using it would help me the flaws.

## [W1] Being able to observe flaws

Due to the HackMD, the many exercises and me talking to students
in the breaks, there was plenty of opportunity to observe flaws
in lesson.

## [W2] Handling feedback

During the lesson, I regularly ask students and TAs for feedback.
I think I always accepted the feedback and thanks the person for it.

I did get the following literal feedback from a TA: 
'The students are completely lost'.
The first second, I accepted this as the ground truth, and that would
have been a problem :-) . 
The second second, I thought about my own observations: I already monitored
the students: 7 out of 7 students did understand why I taught like this.
I asked the TA to quantify the amount of students for the statement:
around 4.
The third second, I estimated that 4 out of 11 students are lost.
Then, I realized that there probably is an effect of the person asking
the question.
I decided to treat my ideas and the TAs ideas as 'just two different ways
of interpreting things'.
In the end, I do change the order in which I teach things.

Other feedback was simpler, such as an exercise being unclear,
a microphone being on or off, etc. I immediately changed the
slides/equipment/etc. I am happy the TAs felt comfortable with sharing this
and I thanked them each time.

## [W3] Time management without a schedule

I chose not to have a timed-out schedule,
as I wanted to see how well I would do without one.
This turned out to work OK, but could be improved.

For example, I knew I had 100 slides, so that means
I need to go through 17 every one of the 6 hours.
This worked out perfectly until lunch: I was at slide 57
and was exactly halfway.
However, I was wrong: in total I would only have 5 hours, hence
I had 2 more hours left.
I did speed up and got through all the theory, 
yet this was at the cost of more hands-on exercises.

I conclude that indeed I can improvise without a timed-out schedule,
yet I do enjoy writing down such a schedule, so I will do so anyways,
when there is the time. On my list of priorities, it would have been the
next thing to do.

## [W4] Student that took the time to compliment me

There was one student that at the end of the day
took some minutes to compliment me on how much he/she
enjoyed my teaching. He/she shared that he/she is a teacher too.

I should write that down in a reflection too :-)

## [I1] The amount of TAs

In the morning I understood I would have three TAs.
I've tried to get one TA.
I was recommended to keep all three.
I disagreed and it was settled I'd have two TAs.

Due to this, I could monitor the progress of the students
less: if I have TAs, I should put them work. I put
the enthusiasm of the TAs over my need to monitor
progress of the students.

Maybe I should have been more ruthless and ignore the
superfluous TAs. I feel one should not ignore humans,
so I feel I did the right thing.

Next time, however, I will be more persistent in 
getting only 1 TA.

## [I2] The learning line of the teaching materials

The learning line went from big picture things
first to smaller things later.
The material, however, was influenced by
a quote from a course teacher: 
'We have no time for TDD'.
I decided to listen to this advice
and I did not put in TDD practices.

This was a bad idea.

Would I have used TDD practices, I would have quickly
started writing tests and functions, like I do
in other courses. The learners would be put to work
quickly.

Instead, I ended up creating exercises that were too vague:
they would write their first assert in a Python
script at around after 4 hours.

## [D1] Have requirements for TAs

I ask my TAs to be there for the students.
That means I will discourage checking emails
and instead, I ask them to observe the students and/or me.
One TA claimed that with such requirements, 
it would be harder to find TAs.

I agree on a logical level, that having more requirements
results in less people satisfying those requirements.

On the other hand, if you intend to do other things while being a TA,
why would one be a TA? Or more important, 
a teacher (including TAs) teach by being an example.
If I would do other things, I cannot blame the students to do so either.
If I do not take learning/teaching seriously, why would my students?

I think getting a TA with the requirement 'Be there for the students'
is The Right Thing.

## [N1] Try to get 1 TA

Too many TAs means me being less in contact with students.

## [N2] Do TDD

The statement 'There is no time for TDD' was false. Just do it!

## [N3] Do live coding

When doing TDD, live coding is a recommended practice.

## Anonymous feedback from students and/or TAs
