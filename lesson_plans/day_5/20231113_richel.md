# Lesson plan 2023-11-12 by Richel

## Learning objectives

 * Being able to use regular expression in a tested function

## Teacher goals

 * Show TDD in live coding
 * Students must code often

## Plan for today

 * Use the existing exercises, prepare the students for those.

I decided not to use most of the existing exercises, 
as I feel they are too artificial.
The first exercise, however, contains some great references:
 * https://regexone.com/
 * https://regexcrossword.com
 * https://regexr.com/

Instead, aim for many TDD cycles instead, gradually building up regex experience.
